# Learning GitHub Actions (gha)

In which I learn about GitHub Actions for CI and CD. I intend to follow the GitHub Actions tutorial ( https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions ) and then apply what I've learned to other projects.

Any GitHub Actions I develop and store in this repository will be general-purpose and easy to use in other projects as quality-of-life items. This includes running Cypress Tests, security scans, performance scans, secret sniffing (useful on private repos) and the like.
